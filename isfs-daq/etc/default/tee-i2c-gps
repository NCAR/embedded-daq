# program to run to tee GPS output, found in /opt/nidas/bin
TEE_PROG=tee_i2c

# I2C device of the GPS
GPS_DEVICE=/dev/i2c-1

# Name of pseudo-terminal to receive GPS messages from tee program
GPS_TEE_DEVICE=/dev/gps_pty0

# I2C address of the GPS
GPS_OPTS=0x42

# The init script also sources /etc/default/gpsd,
# and adds the first value of $DEVICES to these
# options, as a second pseudo-terminal to send data to.

# Note: systemd does not treat this as a bash script,
# and does not support referencing variables in other variables.
# The following won't work the way you expect:
# FOO=$GPS_DEVICE $GPS_I2C_ADDR
# The value of $FOO will contain the string "$GPS_DEVICE" and not its value.
#

# Use for arguments to tee-i2c, such as "-p 30" to set real-time FIFO priority
