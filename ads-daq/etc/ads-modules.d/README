The files in this directory belong to the ads-daq package.
When that package is installed, its postinst script
looks in this directory for a file called $(hostname).conf,
such as dsm319.conf.  If a file is found, it is copied to
/etc/modules-load.d/ads.conf.

If a file called $(hostname).conf is not found
then postinst will copy either viper.conf or titan.conf
to /etc/modules-load.d/ads.conf.

On boot, the system script, /etc/init.d/kmod,
scans files in /etc/modules-load.d and loads any modules
listed in any file there, along with their parameters.

The default driver parameters for NIDAS modules are specified
in /etc/modprobe.d/nidas.conf.  Any parameters specified
for a module in /etc/modules-load.d/ads.conf will over-ride
the defaults in nidas.conf.

The pc104sg IRIG driver is automatically loaded
when needed by other drivers, and so does not need to be
listed in an ads.conf module file, unless you want NIDAS to sample
it anyway, or you want to use other than the default
parameters for a given host.

In a similar way, the usbtwod driver should be automatically
loaded when a 2D probe is connected, and so it does not
need to specified in an ads.conf module file, unless you
want to change the default throttleRate.
