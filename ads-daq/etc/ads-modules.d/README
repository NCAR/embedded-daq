The files in this directory belong to the ads-daq package.
When that package is installed, its postinst script
runs the command /usr/sbin/update_modules_conf, which is
also included in this package.

update_modules_conf looks in this directory for a file called
$(hostname).conf, such as dsm319.conf.  If that file is found,
it is copied to /etc/modules-load.d/ads.conf. If not found,
then the hostname is converted to all lower case and the file is
looked for again.

On boot, the system script, /etc/init.d/kmod,
scans files in /etc/modules-load.d and loads any modules
listed there, along with any parameters.

The default driver parameters for NIDAS modules are specified
in /etc/modprobe.d/nidas.conf. For the Diamond drivers, look
in /etc/modprobe.d/diamond.conf.  Any parameters specified
for a module in /etc/modules-load.d/ads.conf will over-ride
the defaults in nidas.conf or diamond.conf.

The pc104sg IRIG driver is automatically loaded
when needed by other drivers, and so does not need to be
listed in an ads.conf module file, unless you want to
over-ride the default parameters for a given host (or
wanted to sample it anyway and no other loaded drivers need it).

In a similar way, the usbtwod driver should be automatically
loaded when a 2D probe is connected, and so it does not
need to specified in an ads.conf module file, unless you
want to change the default throttleRate.
